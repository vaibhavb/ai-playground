# AI By Hand - Interactive Neural Network Learning App

An interactive JavaScript application for learning neural network concepts through hands-on problem-solving. Users can input exercises and solved examples in Markdown format, and the app creates interactive questions that can be solved on-screen with automatic validation.

## Features

- **Markdown-Based Input**: Define exercises and examples in Markdown format
- **Interactive Problem Solving**: Work through neural network problems step-by-step on screen
- **Automatic Validation**: Real-time checking of user solutions
- **Generic Framework**: Adaptable to any neural network problem (ReLU, activation functions, backpropagation, etc.)
- **Creative UI Design**: Distinctive frontend with unique typography, cohesive color themes, and engaging animations

## Design Philosophy

The app features a creative, non-generic aesthetic:
- **Typography**: Beautiful, distinctive fonts that elevate the learning experience
- **Color & Theme**: Cohesive aesthetic with CSS variables for consistency
- **Motion**: Smooth animations and micro-interactions for engagement
- **Backgrounds**: Atmospheric depth with layered gradients and geometric patterns

## Purpose

This tool helps learners understand neural network concepts by working through problems manually, reinforcing fundamental understanding of how neural networks operate at a computational level.
